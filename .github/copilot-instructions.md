# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## Project Overview
This repository appears to be in its initial setup phase, with only a `README.md` present and no code or documentation describing architecture, workflows, or conventions. There are no discoverable build, test, or integration patterns yet.

## Immediate Guidance
- **No established architecture or components**: The codebase does not currently contain source code, scripts, or configuration files. There are no service boundaries, data flows, or structural decisions to document.
- **No developer workflows**: There are no build, test, or debug commands or files. If you add code, document any new workflows in this file.
- **No project-specific conventions**: No naming, organization, or coding patterns are present. Use standard conventions for your language/framework until project-specific patterns emerge.
- **No integrations or dependencies**: No external dependencies or integration points are defined. If you add any, update this file with details.

## How to Update This File
When new files, components, or workflows are added, update this document to:
- Describe the overall architecture and major components
- List key files and directories
- Document build, test, and debug commands
- Note any project-specific conventions or patterns
- Reference integration points and dependencies

## Example Section Template
```
### Component: <Name>
- Purpose: <Short description>
- Key files: <file1>, <file2>
- Data flow: <How data moves>
- Integration: <External systems/APIs>
- Conventions: <Naming, structure, etc.>
```
